# node-red-contrib-mediasoup
Mediasoup for Node-RED.

I created these custom nodes for an Amateur Radio project to allow operation of amateur radios while in VR. I figured these libraries may be of interest to others so I've decided to make them available under the MIT license. If you are interested in using these nodes in your project and have any questions, you can reach me via Twitter or via Telegram @RucioDonk.

Enjoy!
